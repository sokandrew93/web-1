  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification" >Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the
  standard markup language for <strong> creating <u>web</u> pages </strong>
  and web application.

  <p>New Web developers may mistake HTML for a programming language when it is
     actually a markup language. HTML is used with other technologies because
     all HTML really does is organize documents. On the client side, JavaScript (JS)
     is used to provide interactivity. On the server side, a Web development platform
     like Ruby, PHP or ASP.NET is used.

  </p><p style="margin-top:45px">When a Web developer builds an application,
    the work is performed on the server, and raw HTML is sent out to the user.
    The line between server-side development and client side development is blurry
    with technologies like AJAX.</p><p>HTML was never designed for the Web that exists
    today, as it is just a markup language with severe limitations, in terms of control
    and design. Numerous technologies have been used to work around this issue
    - the most significant being cascading style sheet (CSS).</p><p>The long term solution
      is (or hopefully will be) HTML5, which is the next generation of HTML and allows for
      more control and interactivity. As with any development on the Web, the move
      to standards is a slow and arduous process, and Web developers and designers
      have to make due with current and supported technologies, which means that basic
      HTML will continue to be used for some time.</p>
